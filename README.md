# Hereâ€™s how I prepared:

I just wanted to share that I finally passed my CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) exam! ðŸ™Œ Itâ€™s been a tough journey, but Iâ€™m super excited to have earned this certification!

**Professor Messerâ€™s videos** â€“ These were a game-changer for me. I watched all of his free YouTube videos, took detailed notes, and reviewed them multiple times. His breakdown of the content was spot on.

**Practice questions** â€“ These [practice questions](https://bit.ly/3XnMbhy) were a huge help! I used this to work through tons of realistic practice questions, which gave me a feel for the actual exam format and helped boost my confidence. Highly recommend them for anyone looking for extra practice!

**Practice exams** â€“ Along with DumpsSpot, I took other practice exams I found online. The more I practiced, the better I got at time management and understanding how the questions were structured.

Active recall & repetition â€“ Flashcards were my go-to for memorizing important terms and concepts. I made sure to review them constantly and test myself until I had everything down.

If I can do it, you can too! Keep pushing, stick to your study plan, and use all the resources available. You got this! ðŸ’ª

Good luck to anyone else preparing for their exam! Feel free to ask me any questions about my study process.
